Today I learned

27th November 2025

Today I learned more about what happened last night when I tried to add an about me to my website. I have learnt the basics from Free Code Camp on what to add to the website and how to add a nav (navigation) bar. I added one for the about me section. Eventually I will make it so it opens a new page, but I got lost in the GITHub hole and really enjoyed how it kept breaking. I learnt that it wouldn't push it because of the changes made and it opened VIM which I had no idea how to get out of. Since learned ESC, :wq means save and quit. I also learned that git commit -m "ENTER MESSAGE HERE" is how I can name my file/commit without it opening VIM and confusing me. 
I am currently making a new repo called "Today I learned" and think this is a cool way for me to jot down what I have learned everyday and keep a diary. I have tried doing this the old fashioned way with paper and pen but I love this idea of keeping it digital and it will also count to me being active on GITHub. 
So in doing this I have learnt that mkdir means make directory and then you put the name you would like it to be. I have learned that TOUCH and a name you put here, opens a new notes file but if it is a name that is already taken it will open and update that version. 
it init - initialised git repo
git add TIL.md
git commit -m "Add first TIL notes"
